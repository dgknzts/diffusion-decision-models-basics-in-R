# Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) Basics in R - From Scratch

This repository provides a resource for understanding and implementing the fundamental principles of the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) from scratch using the R programming language. The goal is to present the underlying logic and simulation of the model in the simplest and most accessible way.

This work is heavily inspired by and aims to replicate concepts from "An Introduction to the Diffusion Model of Decision-Making" by Philip L. Smith and Roger Ratcliff.

## Repository Structure

*   **R Functions (`R/`):**
    *   Simulators for simple Random Walks and Diffusion Models
    *   Functions to demonstrate the effects of DDM parameters
    *   Helper functions for visualizing results

*   **Documentation (`vignettes/`):**
    *   Introduction to random walks and their simulation
    *   Simulating the diffusion model and its logic
    *   Understanding DDM parameters (drift rate, threshold, starting point, etc.)
    *   Exploring parameter variability in DDM

*   **Utility Scripts (`scripts/`):**
    *   `update_site.R` - Updates the pkgdown documentation site
    *   `publish_app.R` - Publishes the Shiny app to shinyapps.io
    *   `build_clean.R` - Cleans and rebuilds the documentation

*   **Shiny App (`inst/shiny-app/`):**
    *   Interactive app for exploring DDM parameters and visualizing results
    *   Published online at: https://dgknzts.shinyapps.io/DDM-Basics/

*   **Local Demo (`local-app/`):**
    *   Basic demonstration version of the DDM Shiny app for easy local execution
    *   Simplified version for educational purposes

*   **Documentation Site (`docs/`):**
    *   Generated pkgdown site with tutorials and API reference

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/dgknzts/drift-diffusion-model-basics-in-R.git`
2. Open `DDM_Basics_R.Rproj` in RStudio
3. Explore the vignettes to learn about DDM:
   * Visit the documentation site at https://dgknzts.github.io/drift-diffusion-model-basics-in-R/
   * Or open the R Markdown files in the `vignettes/` folder

## Interactive DDM Explorer

To run the interactive Shiny app locally:

```r
# In R console
shiny::runApp("local-app")
```

Or visit the hosted version at: https://dgknzts.shinyapps.io/DDM-Basics/

## Key DDM Parameters Implemented

*   `v`: Drift rate (mean rate of evidence accumulation)
*   `a`: Threshold separation (boundary separation)
*   `z`: Starting point of evidence accumulation (bias)
*   `ter` (or `t0`): Non-decision time (encoding and response execution time)
*   `s`: Within-trial noise (standard deviation of the normally distributed increments)
*   Parameter variability: `sv`, `sz`, `st0` (across-trial variability in drift, starting point, and non-decision time)

## Running the Local Demo App

To run the basic DDM demo on your local machine:

1. Make sure you have R installed (https://www.r-project.org/)

2. Install the required packages by running the following in R:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "patchwork"))
   ```

3. Clone or download this repository

4. Open R or RStudio and set your working directory to the root of this project

5. Run the demo with:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp("local-app")
   ```

## Features of the Basic DDM Demo

- Interactive parameter adjustment for the DDM
- Visualization of decision paths and RT distributions
- Analysis of parameter variability effects
- Summary statistics for model outputs

## Required File Structure

The demo app expects the following file structure:
- `local-app/app.R` (basic DDM demo app)
- `R/02_ddm_simulator_basic.R` (basic DDM functions)
- `R/03_ddm_simulator_variable.R` (variability functions)
- `R/utils/plot_basic_ddm_path_rt.R` (plotting functions)

If you're having trouble running the demo, check that these files exist in the correct locations.
